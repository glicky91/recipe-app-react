QUESTIONS/UNRESOLVED:   
- I can't figure out how to get my editReicpe to work.
I'm confused on how to make the action button a seperate pages
I didn't organize my files well, can we talk through that?
do we need to import react?

TODO:
-Add form validation to edit recipe and add recipe 
- search? Could be cool to search by catagory but I'm pretty lost on where to start
- could also work with animation more


ANSWERS/SOLVED:
2. For some reason my nav bar won't link to the other pages... need to spend 
    more time going over that section 
    A: fixed this turns out i was importing NavLink from reactstrap vs from react-router-dom
3. I looked at a video and realized that the delete button needs to be in teh same function as your state and map...
2. How do I use map for a second time inside an array? liek I want ingredients to be in bullet points lets say. 
1. How do I add font awesome logos? I tried and got a ton of erros around licensing etc..
     would love for you to walk me through 
3. I'm guessing form section will be what I need to create teh add recipe button. 
8. Can we take a step back a little... when i'm gogoling to help with formatting do i google react bootstrap? css adn tehn use classes??   
    look at bootstrap first then look at reactstrap
